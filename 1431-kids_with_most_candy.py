Strat:
    For a given kid, we just have to see if their candies + extraCandies is the most (or equal to)
    all the other children's. The trick: the kid with the most candy (before extras are added)
    will always be the same.

    Therefore, find the max_candies and iterate through candies to see if kid + extraCandies â‰¥ max_candies.

Speed: O(n) - 2 pass throughs, both O(n)
