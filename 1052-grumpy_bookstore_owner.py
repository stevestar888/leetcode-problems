Strat:
    From a high level approach, we want to find the period of duration X 
    where there are the maximum losses, because they will be compensated 
    for later. We will use sliding window to do this.

Notes:
    Bruce thought of something interesting: we can think of the problem
    where grumpy means the number is negative, and you are trying to max
    the array.

0 = not grumpy
1 = grumpy
