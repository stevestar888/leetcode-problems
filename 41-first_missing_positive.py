Strat: 
    A trick to do this in constant space: store extra info using the sign of each number. 
    We iterate through nums, marking nums[num] as neg if we've seen it before. However,
    before anything, we have to do some preprocessing, i.e., turn negative numbers into
    a number that cannot be the first missing positive (using N + 1, which is slightly larger
    than the size of the array) accomplishes this nicely. Now we just have to make sure 
    we ar checking between 0 < abs(num) â‰¤ N on each iteration.

Runtime: O(n) time, O(1) space -- we take three pass through nums + in place modification
    Runtime: 16 ms, faster than 97.75% of Python online submissions for First Missing Positive.
    Memory Usage: 12.6 MB, less than 5.88% of Python online submissions for First Missing Positive.
