find min energy needed for a drone to make the trip

input:  route = [ [0,   2, 10], (x,y,z)
                  [3,   5,  0],
                  [9,  20,  6],
                  [10, 12, 15],
                  [10, 10,  8] ]

output: 5 # less than 5 kWh and the drone would crash before the finish
          # line. More than `5` kWh and itâ€™d end up with excess energy

Always start at altitude you're given

start: 10
highest = 15

1. iterate through the array
2. look at z coordinate. try to update highest
3. return highest - start


Stats:
  O(n) time (where n is the # of coordinates given)
  O(1) space

Follow up: if you had to consider x,y, and z... ?
    use Euclidean distance = sqrt()
