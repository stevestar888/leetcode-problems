"""
Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.

My approach: 
    In 118-pascal_triangle_i, it made sense to genereate every row. Here, since we only care about
    the k-th row, we can use a clever trick with binomial coefficient: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient.
    Essentially, Pascal's triangle is the same as the binomial coefficient, which can also be 
    represented with combinations: nCr = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)
                                       = n! / r! / (n - r)!
