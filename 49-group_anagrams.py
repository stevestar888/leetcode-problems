Strat: 
    We will use a dictionary, using each anagram group's letter occurance as a key.
    To make things simplier, we can make a list of letter occurances, and then 
    caste that to a string. For example, "abe" becomes [a: 1, b: 1, e: 1], aka
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, ...]. At the end, the keys in the dictionary
